## Overview
Moonshine.jl is a Julia framework for coalescent modelling oriented towards ancestral recombination graph (ARG) inference. It provides the [`AbstractGenealogy`](https://moonshine.patrickfournier.ca/stable/reference/AbstractGenealogy/#Moonshine.AbstractGenealogy) type which leverages [Graph.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl) for convenient implementation of graph-theoretical models of molecular evolution.

## Installation
As usual, from julia's REPL, enter [Pkg mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) by pressing `]`. Then,
```julia-repl
pkg> add Moonshine
```

## Documentation
This readme is austere by design. [Full Documentation](https://moonshine.patrickfournier.ca/stable/) as well as a [quickstart tutorial](https://moonshine.patrickfournier.ca/stable/quickstart) are available on a dedicated website. The tutorial is targeted towards experienced as well as first-time julia users.
